# System Programming: Aforementioned Paradigm
- This is my midterm project for GTU System Programming Spring 2022. The detailed instructions are under the midterm_instructions pdf.

## Objective
- The main idea of this project is to simulate the aforementioned paradigm with 2 process-pooled servers: Y and Z executing on the same system as the clients.
- There are 3 programs to be implemented: client X, server Y and server Z. 
- There will be a single instance of Y and of Z, and there can be an arbitrary number of client processes X, all running concurrently. 
- Each client will submit a matrix to the server Y, and receive a response (from Y or Z) about whether it is invertible or not.
